				<p>I call it luck. I call it luck. In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home! Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.</p>
				<p>Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. You mean it controls your actions? Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. <strong> I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything.</strong> <em> There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.</em> It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.</p>

			<p>She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time! The Force is strong with this one. I have you now.</p>
			<p>I'm trying not to, kid. I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base. No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possiblyâ€¦ In my experience, there is no such thing as luck.</p>
