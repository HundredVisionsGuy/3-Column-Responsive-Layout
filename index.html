Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. <strong> I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything.</strong> <em> There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.</em> It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.</p>

			<p>I'm trying not to, kid. I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base. No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possiblyâ€¦ In my experience, there is no such thing as luck.</p>
